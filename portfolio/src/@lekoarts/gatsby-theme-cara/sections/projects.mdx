  A web application for the U.S. Space Force that will replace an outdated paper
  performance review method. Users will take daily, weekly and monthly surveys
  that will give data about their superiors, subordinates, and peers. Our web
  application will then display the appropriate data to the user, depending on
  what team they are on, what rank they have and what their job is in the Space
  Force. My main responsibility was for the development of the backend API and
  the creation of the MongoDB database.\
